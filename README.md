# ROSbot + UAV ‚Äî Ground Robot with Aerial Surveillance

**ROSbot** is a differential-drive ground robot built using **ROS 2 Jazzy**. It is equipped with a 2D LiDAR for SLAM and navigation and uses an Arduino for motor control. A **UAV (drone)** is mounted on top to provide **aerial surveillance**, giving a combined ground and aerial view of the environment.

## üìñ Project Overview
This project integrates a mobile ground robot and a UAV into a single platform. The ROSbot handles ground navigation, obstacle avoidance, and mapping, while the drone enables aerial surveillance for extended situational awareness. The system is designed for both **simulation in Gazebo** and **deployment on real hardware**.
